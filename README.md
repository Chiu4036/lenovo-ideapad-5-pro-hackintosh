I managed to install macOS monterey on my 11th gen intel tiger lake device!

1.key specs

cpuï¼š11th gen 1155g7

gpu: intel iris xe uma graphics

wifi: intel wifi-6 ax201

aduio card:

ssd: wd 512gb

2.what's working

keyboard

wifi

integrated camera

3.need to work

gpu--casues lag and irrespondence in the transition animation of minimizing windows

bluetooth--driver is successfully loaded but won't work

trackpad

audio input & output

usb ports

as you can see this is still a faulty work at its very stages, so i think some of you may would like to work with me and make it a better-established repo in which people share common hardware may find value!
